I would like to become part of the community of IT programmers, the priority is to develop skills with backend. In my opinion it is reasonable to start to work with front end. I have experience in different fields and directions, such as design, engineering and manufacturing. There has always been a desire to learn something new in the IT field. I am aware that studing isn't easy, but that doesn't  stop me from achieving my aim. In 2021, I studied in the IT laboratory of Mogilev Regional Development Agency basis on the Belarusian-Russian University by the topic “Internet Technologies” and defended the final work. I had study HTML, CSS, JavaScript during the training. My final task was a site-gallery without placement in www. The library of the jQuery gallery was taken as a basis and redesigned. I would like to represent the code. I have no work experience in the IT field. I had study at rolling-scopes-school stage 0.
